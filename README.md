ActiveTextView
=========

This project consists of a few examples demonstrating how to draw selectable multicolored text in iOS.

Summary
-----------

ActiveTextView was developed because drawing multi-colored selectable text on iOS is a pain. The sources offered here won't likely be a perfect drop in solution for developers requiring this functionality, but we feel it demonstrates how to accomplish much of the most desired functionality with respect to multi colored text rendering.

Known Issues
--------------

Currently, when highlighting selected regions (either with the SlidingTextSelector, or the static background) ActiveTextView doesn't handle regions that span multiple lines.
